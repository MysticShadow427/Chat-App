chat app banayenge follow the course
src folder for all node js scripts
port and public directory path ko confihure karna hai 
path is a core node module, __dirname means current folder
we ned to serve up the our folder to express middleware hence app.use express.static
 we will modify package .json with making a "start"script  to bootstart the app using node  
 to agar apn ne npm run start ye likha to server start ho jaayega nice
 and also dev dependcncies for nodemon make a dev script 
 dev dependcncies vo rahte jo hame bas apnea app locally run karne ke liye lagte 
 and for this to run npm run dev command in terminal 
 *web socket protocol-
 web sockets allow full duplex communication means a bidrectional communication wheerein a server or a client both can initiate communication 
 and with web socket ek baar client connect ho gaya to it stays forever until it wants and the server sends data got from another client to another client instantly
 we will use socket.io to make socket servers and also client side code to communicte with this server 
 now this server is different from regular hence we ned to modify the express server accordingly with socket.io 
 we will make a http server and pass it to our express app and instead of "app" we will use "server" hecen server.listen() and now we make a socketio ka instance and pass our http server to this 
 io.on() jab koi event hoga to ye crow and it has 2 arg name of event and fucntion to run after that event happens and 'connection' is an event but we will not get anything unless we connect to our server hence we need to make client side code also and we will take this from the file served by socket.io server as it serves a file for clients when we initialoze it and we will include it in our index.html public folder ki and the file name is socket.io.js and hence to write this c
 lient side code we will make folder in public to store our js files 
 we call io() in chat.js to access the server in it 
 now we will learn by example about socket.io ke evenrts -
 the server will store a number called count and it will share that with all the clients,the client will have button to increment and again share it to cleints
 on.connection ke arg ke func ka arg ek socket rehata and it has functions and info about the conection,ek io.connection() runs utne number of time jitne number of clients connect hue and to send that data to newly connected client we use socket.emit() 1st arg us name of event 
now on client side io() jo client ko access dilata hai usko var me store karenge hence const socket=io() and here in client side we have
socket.on() 2 args and 1st is event and the name should be same and 2nd is calback function  , jo bhi server se bhej rahe hai emit() me vo saafre client side me as a callback function ke arg me mil jaate and gen naam same rakho ,abhi index.html me ek button bana do and aisa karo ki button clicke pe count +1 ho jaaye and vo server ko bhejnge ye js ka code chat.js means cleint side 
to send from client also we use socket.emit() when button is clicked and ye server side js code me isko apan socket.on() se listen karenge and usme count++ karke socket.emit kar denge same last vala event jo server ne bheja tha ...but this whole code is only for a single connection eg-
ek client connec hua and button click krke coutn change kiya to jo naya count  hoga vo new connectred client ko dikhega but abhi agar pahele client ne button click karke coubt badhaya to vo bas usi user ko dikhega jisne button click kiya hence aisa na hone ke liye we do io.emit() rather than seocket.emit() n3-17-05 ka code dekho iske liye 
ham m=form se input bhejnege usse event bhejkar message bhejneg server ko and we stop its default behaviour so after refresh???
const message=e.target.elements.message this causes to crash ;less e is what we get from our query selector and .message is the name property of that element
broadcasting events-
for eg if a user joins the chatroom all users will get some message that new user joined and if someone left so all will get a meessage user left
and this message will not go to the user who joins or lefts
so we have for this a function socket.broadcast.emit which sends a message to everybody execpt this socket ,...socket.broadcast.emit('message','a new user joined')
hecne now we have 3 types of emits chamka kon kon se?
now what if a client gets disconnected wehave a function called as socket.on('disconnect',()=>{
    this func will rin after a client gets disconnected
})
sharing location-
we will be sharing each other location by typing some client side javascript code by using apis ,we will be using mdn geolocation api 
agar brosers me navigator.geolocation naame ki property run ho sakti to hi ye api run ho sakta hai 
and then we will use .getCurrPos with a callback function with a argument position which has all the results ,now by console.logging we can check what properties do we have acces to 
socket.on() to listennn ye mat bhulo yaar and through a callback funtion we have access to that
*event acknowledgemt-
means kuch hua to jisne kiya usko jiske liye kiya usse kuch feedback milna chahiye 
abhi jo socket.emit() hai usme 3rd arg ek callback fucntionhai jo acknowledgemt show karne ke liye hai to ham kya karenge ki usme vo event success ke bad kya hoga vo likhenge and iske event listener ke callback function me 2nd arg ek function daalenge here callback naam ka and we will call that at the last and these both callback are same means ye jo hamare do functions ki hamne baat ki vo same hi hai vahi run hoga means acknowledgemt functionnrun hoga sender ke pass but jo hame arg diya na extra ka vo vahi function ha and abhi
recievr ke event listener me jo hamne last line pe callback ko run kkiya us function me ham bohot saare argument bhi pass kar sakte and uske ham acdess jaha pe event emit kiya tha vaha pe access kar sakte and vo args jo ham bhejnege vo jaha se bheja hai vaha ke acknowledgemt function ke arg rahenege 
now we can use this feedback mechanism for our chat validation means bad words can be excluded amd we can send a warning message and we have a npm module called bad-words for this lo man so great to have xD
 
bhai yaha pe apan kya sikh rahe ki pahle  backend without gui kro and test by usning just console.log calls and then add to gui 

now we will do some  aise changes ki agar send location button pe click kiya to firse nahi click kar sakta for 2 seconds aise and jo apna send message ka jo form hai usme ham jo likhte hai vo clear nahi hota to use clear karna hai aise chnages karenge 
$ sign se kisi varibale ka naam likha means vo dom ka koi element hai
we disabeled the button and we will enable it in our acknowledgemt  and to clear the input we will set it to empty string   and vo focus() se we will bring the cursor inside the input form 
samwe for send location button we wil diable it and enable it in the acknowledgemt

rendering messages-
we want to show these messages on the webpqge ratther than on console so we will use a library called mustach that helps to connect html and js code to render on the webspage means dynamic content dikhayega 
abhi uske liye index.html me 1 div banaya jisme dynamic content daalenge and fir ek script banaya jisme notice krna js nahi balki html hai 
and now we will go to chat.js to render this in the socket.on('message' event vala code)
inertAdjacemt html-helps to add more html other than out html there and 1st arg is position where to insert 4 pos hai 
means yaha apn ne kya kiya ki kisi or div element ka code kisi dusre div element me daal diya and apan ne message event me likha hai means jab jab ham kuch to mess likhke submit karenge to vo vaha upar dynamically add hote rahega ....ok this was a good step now remember {{}} and hbs files here we not use hbs but mustach so jo bhi {{}} ikse andar likhenge vo aayega nice!,so index.html me {{}} dalo and fir chat.js me mustach.render me 2nd arg daalo and vo ek object rahega to iske key value pairs me se keys rahege jo hame template se access karenge and vo kya rahegi means value kya rahegi jo hamara arg hai function ka jo ham server se bhej rahe vo jisko apan ne message naam diya 

abhi ham jab location fire off karenge to vo text aa raha but hme location aisa nahi chaiye hence we need to do somen restructuring by making new event and rebdering  a new template and url in the {{}} and _blank so new tab me khulega and follow same procedure 

ham ek hi event ko baar bar emit kar sakte jaise hamne message event ko kiya hai but usko fir ek hi code se sambhalna padega ofc 

*working with time-
we will use date object in javascript to generate current dates here ,and we will send objects rather than sending string messages but it is a hectic task and repeation of code hence we make a new folder utils and usme new file messages.js and vaaha se function export ksreneg and also we need to make changes in chat.js as now message is a object 
now we will use librarry called moments to works with timestamps

*join page-
now as per naming conventionn index is first page so index.html will be bjoin page and chat.html will be chatroom
form action se page chnage hota and isse apni query strig auto generate hui nice an we will use that 

rooms in socket.io-
location.search se hame kisi bhi url ki query string ka access milega and further refined by the qs library we included we can filter it and then we will make a new emit to emit join
socket.join is a special function that is used on server side to k=join a room 
io.to.emit() emits for group of people joined only to that room ,same for socket.broadcast.to.emit() all in the room except that person
